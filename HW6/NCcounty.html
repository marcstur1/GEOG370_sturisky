<h4>The map above is analyzing census data of every North Carolina county. The map compares county data of number of residents with a graduate or professional degree. As seen on the map due to having the darkest shade of purple, Wake County has the most residents with a graduate or professional degree. On the other end, the countries that are white on the map have the least residents with a graduate degree. </h4>
