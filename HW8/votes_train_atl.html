    <h2>Homework 8</h2>

    <h4> My real-life question that I attempt to answer through both geoprocessing and my maps below is "How close in proximity are Greater Atlanta Region train stations to Fulton County poll sites?" </h4>

    <h4>The first map below demonstrates the entire Atlanta region:</h4>

 <h4>As you can see, the poll sites are strictly in Fulton county while train stations extended out into border counties. The below map is focused on where these two pieces of data intersected.</h4>

 <h4>I put a buffer zone around all of the poll sites to represent close commutes that people can take to get to those poll sites. If a train station is located within one of those buffer zones, the train station point will have a purple dot in the center of the traditional black dot. I used both the buffer and the intersect geoprocessing tools to make this possible. I found this question an interesting one, using Atlanta as the example, because it is so important to be a voting citizen and should be made as easy as possible. I wanted to see if Atlanta train stations were close to the poll sites to see if I could understand a little more how easily reached they are for someone without a car. Obviously, buses and ubers would be other options for carless transport, but someone without a car in close proximity of a station, could go vote and then easily jump on a station to head to their job or another destination around the city. Train systems are less common in US cities than many other countries and Atlanta's lag behind New York, Washington DC, Chicago, and others, in terms of footprint across the city. However, it is good to see that there were quite a few stations in close proximity to a polling site. If Atlanta had more train routes across Fulton county, more of these black dots would have some purple in the middle.</h4>
